# Project-Uragon
A text-based RPG that communicates with other users through a CSR mesh.

## About
This is a multi-part project which is being developed for both iOS and Android platforms.
It will consist of the following 2 parts:
* Mobile Application
  * This will be the engine that runs the game and parses incoming commands from the Bluetooth LE Suite
* Mesh Bluetooth LE Suite
  * This will manage all incoming connections
  
## Tech Used
This project is being developed using [NativeScript](https://www.nativescript.org/) . With every addition of
third party libraries, we will do our best to place it here.

## Goals
* To develop a robust mesh Bluetooth LE Suite that can be used across iOS and Android platforms. 
Once that goal has been accomplish, it will be separated and be made available as an open source project.
* An interactive, immersive and highly customisable text-based RPG that can be played anywhere.
